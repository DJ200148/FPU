# 180FPU

## Digital Systems II floating point unit, capable of multiplication, addition and subtraction.

The project is optimized for speed rather than cost.

It can handle 32-bit IEEE, 16-bit bfloat, 8-bit E4M3, 8-bit E5M2.

This project can be easily compiled and launched to a DE10-lite board using quartus.
